1. Sidebar Theme Updated
The sidebar (Online Users section) now uses a dark background (bg-gray-800) and white text (text-white) to create contrast and a modern look.

On hover, user entries highlight with a darker shade (hover:bg-gray-700), making it feel interactive.

2. Chat Room Background Enhanced
The entire background of the chat room is now a light gray (bg-gray-100), giving it a soft and clean appearance.

This makes the chat bubbles and input area stand out more clearly.

3. Message Bubble Styling Improved
Each message is placed in a white card (bg-white) with padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow using shadow, making it look like a speech bubble.

This visual separation helps users easily distinguish individual messages.

4. Chat Header Changed
The top chat room bar now uses a matching gray (bg-gray-100) with a bottom border (border-b border-gray-300), keeping it consistent with the rest of the UI.

5. Input Box Styling Updated
The message input box is now light gray (bg-gray-100), rounded like a modern input field, and highlights when focused using focus:ring-blue-500.

The send button is a bold blue (bg-blue-600) circle with a hover effect, giving it a clean and interactive look.
